# minishell @ 42 w/ sadarnau

The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. Yes, your little bash or zsh. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

This project use an abstract syntax tree. It's certainly an elegant solution (inspired by mysh by Swoorup), but really not the easiest one.
